# Cat-Quest
"Cat Quest" is a self paced adventure game, with all original pixel art and programming. Collect fish, buy power-ups, and save Suki's brother! Uses framework Pygame.

Created before I had formal programming education. The code isn't very well formatted or adherent to conventions, but it represents my early efforts in building something cool and usable.
