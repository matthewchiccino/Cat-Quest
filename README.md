# Cat-Quest
"Cat Quest" is a self paced adventure game, with all original pixel art and programming. Collect fish, buy power-ups, and save Suki's brother! Uses framework Pygame.

Created before I had formal programming education, the code reflects my early efforts and passion for creating a fun and useable product. The game was made as a gift.
